# Car Sales Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)

## Project Objective

To support this, I have designed and developed a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard visualises key KPIs related to car sales, helping the company understand its performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
