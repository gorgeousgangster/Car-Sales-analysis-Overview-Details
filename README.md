# Car Sales Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
A car dealership company wants to create a car sales report to effectively track and analyse its sales performance for the years 2022 and 2023. To support this, I have designed and developed a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard visualises key KPIs related to car sales, helping the company understand its performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
